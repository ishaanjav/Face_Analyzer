## Data Used
### Data you provide
-	Image containing people’s faces:
    - From camera
    - From photo gallery

### Data calculated by app
-	Estimated age.
-	Estimated gender.
- Estimated emotions.
-	Estimated probabilities of having facial hair.
-	Estimated head position in degrees.

## Purpose of Data Collection
Data is collected to provide the primary service of analyzing the faces within an image and displaying the resulting information.
Without being given an image from the user, the app wouldn’t be able to function as intended. 

Therefore, the app receives the image either through the camera or a picture that the user chooses from the photo gallery.

## Who Can See Your Data
**Only the user of the app.**

The only person who can view the image and the facial information is the user of the app. The data the app collects is not stored or sent anywhere and remains within the app, locally. Additionally, once the app is closed from memory, the data is cleared and is only available while the app is open.

## Permissions the App Uses
Upon installation, the app asks for camera permission and permission to access photos and media stored in the device's storage. Only one of these is necessary to use the app, but using both is recommended.

However, the app will not be able to serve its purpose if neither one of the permissions are granted.

## Disclaimer
**Please keep in mind that the app is not 100% accurate.** Therefore, it may not be able to accurately determine your age or gender every time it is used.

For more information on how the app determines your facial attributes, you can check out the [Microsoft Face API.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) which is the tool that the app uses to determine the facial attributes.

## Your Privacy Rights
You have the ability to revoke the app’s camera permission from your device’s Settings. Once this done, the app will not have accees to the camera or photo gallery. 

However, it is important to note that doing so will prevent it from serving its purpose of providing facial information from images.
